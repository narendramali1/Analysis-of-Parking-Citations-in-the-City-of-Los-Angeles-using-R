# Analysis-of-Parking-Citations-in-the-City-of-Los-Angeles-using-R
The dataset we have chosen is Parking Citation, City of Los Angeles from Data.Lacity.Org. Parking is a growing concern in LA City with many places having limited free parking and permit required in certain places and communities. We aim to find out insights on highest number of parking citation faced by Time, Place, Fine amount, Registered State Plates and also the violation description depending upon the latitude and longitude. This analysis will help us to understand and recognize extra parking required in certain areas with less or reserved/permit parking.
